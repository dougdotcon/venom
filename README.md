Hello everyone,

We are excited to announce that **Venom** is now officially part of the new communication ecosystem: **ERA CONNECT‚Ñ¢**, powered and maintained by **VYNECT‚Ñ¢**.

---

## ‚ùó Important Information

As of this announcement, **Venom will no longer continue as an open-source project**.

Instead, Venom will move to a **freemium** model:
